~~~ Developers Note ~~~

This is a small project I am working on to overall improve my skills working with python, especially regarding class interactions.
I am using purely pygame and python in order to create this.

Right now, I only plan on making 1 usable level. 

I hope you overall enjoy watching me struggle to move this game forward. Who knows, it might be pretty good soon!
